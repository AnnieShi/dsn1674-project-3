	<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>The narwhal <m>(Monodon monoceros)</m> is famous for its long ivory tusk that spirals counter-clockwise
up to 9 feet forward from the head of adult males. Its for this reason that the narwhal has been dubbed
the unicorn of the sea. Hundreds of years ago, those tusks were thought by some to have magical properties.
It’s only recently that research has shown that the narwhal tusk has some remarkable sensory capabilities –
with millions of nerve endings in there, perhaps to help in locating food.
Narwhals spend their lives in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway
and Russia. Cracks in the ice allow them to breathe when needed, especially after dives,
which can be up to a mile and a half deep. They feed mainly on Greenland halibut,
along with other fish, squid and shrimp.</p>

<h2 id="imp">Importance</h2>

<p>Narwhals are considered equal to whales in the food chain, and therefore are placed at the top.
	This makes their presence of vital importance to the overall health of the marine
	environment. Narwhals also depend on sea ice to survive.
	Therefore, how its population is affected by climate change is of
	great importance to us. However, the narwhal’s importance isn’t limited
	to the environment, it also holds a culturally important place in the lives
	of communities indigenous to the Arctic.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="threats">Threats</h2>
<p>As mentioned above the narwhal, like other Arctic species, have evolved to live on
	and around sea ice.  That ice cover has been rapidly changing due to climate change.
	As it shrinks far too quickly so too does the narwhal population. The narwhal
	is now considered a near-threat species.
If this were not enough, ocean noise caused from shipping, marine construction
and industrial extraction of marine resources has a negative
impact on the narwhal population. The noise pollution interferes with their
ability to find food and mates, avoid predators and even navigate.</p>
